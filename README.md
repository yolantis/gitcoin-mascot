# gitcoin-mascot
This is my submission to GitCoin's POAPathon challenge to create a POAPathon mascot. Project detail page: https://gitcoin.co/issue/poapathon/poapathon2021/9/100027135
PLEASE NOTE: I submitted this graphic twice - once through Google Drive and it looks like the link to the drive file and the directory are both broken, so this version is the one that supercedes the submission labeled "Mascot" from Yolantis. I didn't see a way to delete an obsolete project submission. Nov 18, 2021.
